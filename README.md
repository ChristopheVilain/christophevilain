## Hello ! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christophe Vilain, a French software engineer. I currently work as a Lead Engineer.  
I'm mostly into infrastructure : provisioning our cloud, monitoring our production, managing the SSO, CICD chains, and some backend development.  

Most importantly, all my tools use a light theme.  

### About Me

My first love was engineering sciences and technical drawing, which I studied during my time in a Class PrÃ©paratoires course (PTSI).  
I then graduated a telecommunications engineer from [ISEP](https://www.isep.fr/) in 2015 but I quickly reoriented towards software engineering.  

I first learned my trade at [Worldline](https://worldline.com/) working in different projects such as authentication, contactless phone payment, and the French emergency medial software, SAMU.  
I then joined [Taster](https://taster.com) in 2022, where I work with Python, Bash, many infrastructure flavors from Google Cloud, container ecosystems (like k8s) and Keycloak.
