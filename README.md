## Hello ! üëã

I'm Christophe Vilain, a French software engineer. I currently work at [Taster](https://taster.com) where I'm a DevOps engineer.  
In this position, I do all kind of things backend-related : provisioning our cloud infrastructure, managing our SSO and CICD chains, and backend development.  

I enjoy learning and mastering new technologies but I still enjoy me a bash script and a good regex. Also, all my tools use a light theme.  

### About Me

I graduated a telecommunications engineer from [ISEP](https://www.isep.fr/) in 2015, but quickly reoriented towards software engineering.  
I first learned my trade at [Worldline](https://worldline.com/) working in different projects such as authentication, contactless phone payment, and the French emergency medial software, SAMU. I then joined Taster in 2022.  

At first, I worked on Java EE projects as a backend Engineer. Developping an interest in infrastructure in general, I worked closer and closer with Worldline's datacenter teams, eventually becoming a DevOps engineer.  
These days at Taster, I work with Python, Bash (‚ù§Ô∏è), many infrastructure flavors from Google Cloud, container ecosystems (like k8s) and Keycloak.
