## Hello ! üëã

I'm Christophe Vilain, a French software engineer. I currently work at [Taster](https://taster.com) where I'm a Lead Engineer.  
In this position, I do all kind of things backend-related : provisioning our cloud infrastructure, managing our SSO and CICD chains, and backend development. For the latter, I work with other engineers in a sort of engineering manager position, but I still code.  

I also spend some time researching new trendy tech that could be implemented in our own stack. I propose yearly roadmaps to the CTO and Head of Engineering pertaining to the DevSecOps perimiter, that I then implement while still working on business projects.  

I enjoy learning and mastering new technologies but I still love me a bash script and a good regex. Also, all my tools use a light theme.  

### About Me

My first love was engineering sciences and technical drawing, which I studied during my time in a Class Pr√©paratoires course (PTSI).  
I was accepted into [ISEP](https://www.isep.fr/), where I graduated a telecommunications engineer in 2015. But I quickly reoriented towards software engineering.  

I first learned my trade at [Worldline](https://worldline.com/) working in different projects such as authentication, contactless phone payment, and the French emergency medial software, SAMU.  

At first, I worked on Java EE projects as a backend Engineer. Developping an interest in infrastructure in general, I worked closer and closer with Worldline's datacenter teams, eventually becoming a DevOps engineer.  
I then joined Taster in 2022, where I work with Python, Bash (‚ù§Ô∏è), many infrastructure flavors from Google Cloud, container ecosystems (like k8s) and Keycloak.
